# Big-Book-of-Small-Python-Projects

I have been teaching myself Python by reading *The Self Taught Programmer* by Cory Althoff. Now that I feel I have a somewhat good understanding, I need to practice more. I came across *The Big Book of Small Python Projects* by Al Sweigart and have decided to build these projects for practice.

Since I'm doing this for practice and to ensure that I am retaining the information, I will not be looking at the solutions at this time. Instead, I'll be focusing on writing my own code and making sure that the code works, even if it may not be optimal.

I may or may not come back in the future to optimize my code.

With the recent popularity of AI, I will be using Copilot to assist me in performing certain tasks. Mainly to help me recall information. E.g. code syntax, or to introduce me to concepts that I may not be familiar with. However, again, because I am making sure that I can recall on my knowledge, I will be trying to keep this to a minimal. 

This should achieve two goals. The first one being to make sure that I can utilize AI as I believe this might become more common practice. The second being to use it as learning tool in order to (hopefully) make me a better dev through the introduction of new concepts.
